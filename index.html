    <h2>Is the Giant Anteater giant and an ant eater?</h2>
    <p>Yeah (Comparative Mammalian Brain Collections, n.d.). </p>
  </div>
  <div class="anteater_explanation">
    <h2>What is the Giant Anteater?</h2>
    <p>Giant Anteaters are a species of anteater that, well, eat ants (and termites) (Comparative Mammalian Brain Collections, n.d.). Equipped with an insanely long, slender snout
      it acts as a mechanism to swiftly and safely consume prey, with its tongue reaching up to two feet long! For comparison, the Giant Anteater's tail reaches up to three feet long
      and its body able to reach over six feet long.<p>
  </div>
  <div class="anteater_location">
    <h2>Where is the Giant Anteater?</h2>
    <p>The Giant Anteater generally exists around parts of Central America and South America (Comparative Mammalian Brain Collections, n.d.; Giroux et al., 2022). More specifically:
    <div class="ant_central">
    <p>Central America</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Belize</li>
      <li>Guatemala</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="ant_south">
    <p>South America</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Uruguay</li>
      <li>Bolivia</li>
      <li>Brazil</li>
      <li>Argentina</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Giant anteaters generally reside in tropical forests and grassy plains (Comparative Mammalian Brain Collections, n.d.). More recently, though, Giroux et al. (2022) found a correlation between
      lowering environmental temperature and an inclination for Giant Anteaters to cluster within forests (at least within Brazil), seemingly due to the Giant Anteater's lower body temperature and
    forests' higher retention of heat compared to other environments.</p>

  <div class="anteater_brain">
    <h2>What does its brain look like?</h2>
    <p>Wow, that's kind of morbid. But since you asked so nicely, it looks like this:</p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Not entirely sure if it was obvious, but look at how small its brain is for such a large animal! With the scale provided in the left image, it only measures around 10 or so centimeters! Yet, even though
      the Giant Anteater's brains lacks size, it possesses larger olfactory bulbs (see: the bottom right column in the left image) in relation to the human brain. The prominence of the Giant Anteater's
       olfactory bulbs might explain the complex spatial abilities Giant Anteater possess for finding prey and marking territory (see: "What behaviors do Giant Anteaters exhibit?") (Allard et al., 2014; Shaw et al., 1987).
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="anteater_behaviors">
  <h2>What behaviors do Giant Anteaters exhibit?</h2>
  <p>Due to Giant Anteaters' poor eyesight, they tend to use their snout to aid in their navigation (Allard et al., 2014). In particular, the Giant Anteaters' seem to use their heightened sense
    of smell to locate previous sources of food, with Allard et al. (2014) finding that Giant Anteaters seemed to perform well at remembering the locations of baited feeders within a radial arm maze
    (i.e., a maze with a set amount of arms with a reward in one or a few of the arms that's often used to test working memory for animals).
  </p>
  <p>Giant Anteaters also seem to possess a knack for marking and determining territory (Allard et al., 2014; Shaw et al., 1987). Giant Anteaters tend to use their claws to mark trees, signifying their "home."
    When taking note of the behavior of Giant Anteaters at Serra da Canastra National Park in Minas Gerasis, Brazil, Shaw et al., (1987) noticed that Giant Anteaters tend to partake in agonistic behaviors
    when interacting with one another, sometimes circling, chasing, or directly fighting one another. The Giant Anteaters participating in agonistic behaviors tend to be male, with female Giant Anteaters demonstrating
     a larger overlap in territory (Allard et al., 2014).
